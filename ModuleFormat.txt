===Required Routines===
All modules must have a BEGIN block:

BEGIN {
	$VERSION = X.XX;  #version number for the module
	$Config::modules{'ModuleName'} = 1;  #Name of the module goes here
}




All modules must have the following routines:
*  A sub named "examine" which takes an input string, a channel, and a nick for who said it 
** This will parse the input to do work. It will be called every time a line is spoken.
** It should return '1' if the input was parsed by it, or '0' if the input meant nothing to it

* A sub named module_info
** This should take a channel as input and send to the output queue information about the module.


===Helpful Hints===
*To print to the IRC queue, call Logios::IRCPrint("#channel","Output to print"). 
** This will break up overly long input as well as handle the POE coordination. Just go ahead and send raw input to it.
** To print characters in bold, use "\x02" as the bold-toggle (Example: "a \x02bold\x02 word"). 

*To print to the log, use Logios::log

*It is more polite to prefix your module's commands with !Modulenmae
** For example, !Module command is nicer than !Command

*A help file should go in the /Help folder 
** Help files should store a list of commands and a blurb about each one
** It is polite to have your module respond to !modulename Help and !Modulename with information from this help file.
